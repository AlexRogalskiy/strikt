## Ferocious Daughter

### New features

- `succeeded` and `failed` deprecated in favor of `isSuccess` and `isFailure`.
- added `Assertion.Builder<Enum<T>>.isOneOf` assertion.

### Fixes

- `single` now displays the number of elements found if it fails. See [#210](https://github.com/robfletcher/strikt/issues/210)
- Improved description of `task` mapping. See [#218](https://github.com/robfletcher/strikt/issues/218)
